# Drop7 Reinforcement Learning Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to create a Deep Learning algorithm capable of playing a game similar to Zynga's Drop7. 

## The Game

Drop7 is a smartphone strategy game produced by Zynga. The goal of the game is to keep the balls from getting to the top of the 7x7 grid. Balls pop if the ball is connected either vertically or horizontally to the number on the ball. New rows of gray balls appear over time that must have balls pop near them before they reveal their number. A more thorough explanation of the game can be found [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_RLjEruSx8) (Note: this game shows several game modes, this challenge focuses only on "blitz mode")
